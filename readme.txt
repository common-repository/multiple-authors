Obsolete multi-author plugin. Use Co-Authors or Co-Authors Plus instead.

== Description ==

This plugin provided basic multiple author support. It has been supplanted by better plugins like [Co-Authors](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors/) and [Co-Authors Plus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/). It may be resurrected some day, if those plugins are no longer sufficient.
